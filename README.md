Project Overview:

The application encompasses various facets of Object-Oriented Programming.  It involves receiving data from a designated file via a command-line interface, which is then used to instantiate objects.  These instantiated objects are essential to the app’s functionality, facilitating tasks such as editing, aggregation, and display of information.  To ensure persistence between application runs, a feature has been implemented to convert the instances of these objects into a structured list format that is then written back to the data file.
